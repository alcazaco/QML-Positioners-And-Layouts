## Getting Started

- In this repo, you will find a selection of projects you will create if you follow along with the course on Qt Academy.
- Each folder (apart from `00-Assets`) represents a progress point after each section of the course.
- The `00-Assets` folder contains all of the assets you will needed to follow along.
- If you get stuck or encounter an issues, you can use these as references to get back up to speed and compare your progress.
- Folder `04-LayoutItemProxy` also contains code snippets you can copy and paste to get you up to speed if you skipped the previous section.

## Instructions

To get started with this project, you will need to have Qt and an IDE (e.g Qt Creator) installed on your computer. You can download Qt and Qt Creator from the [Qt.io website](qt.io).

Once you have Qt and an IDE installed, head over to [Qt Academy](academy.qt.io) and follow along to create the project template and add the assets to the project.

To run a version of the project from a specific section, navigate to the desired section folder in Qt Creator and open the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Build and run the project in Qt Creator. The application will launch and you will see the application at that current stage.

Please note that in order to run the each section, you will need to copy the resources from the `00-Assets` folder into the section you wish to run. The assets are not included in the section folders to keep the repo size small.

## Resouces

Attributions for any assets used can be found in the `attributtion.txt` file in the `00-Assets` folder.
